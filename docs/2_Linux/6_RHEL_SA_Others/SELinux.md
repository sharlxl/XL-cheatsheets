# What is Apache?

Apache is the most widely used web server software.  
Apache is not any physical server; it is software that executes on the server.  
However, we define it as a web server.  
Its objective is to build a connection among the website visitor browsers (Safari, Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and the server.  
Apache can be defined as cross-platform software, so it can work on Windows servers and UNIX.

Other Web Servers, like Apache, would be Nginx, Tomcat.
