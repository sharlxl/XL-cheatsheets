# National Infocomm Competency Framework(NCIF)

What is a network?

- network is nothing more than two connected comouters sharing resources with one another.
- physical connection/component(wires, cables, wireless media)
- logical connection/component(data transporting accross physical media)

## Computer Networks

#### Basic networking rules.

- Computers in the same network must use the same procedures for sending and recieving data. - Communication Protocols
- Data must be delivered uncorrupted. IF it is corrupted, it is useless. (there are exceptions.)
- computers in a network must be capable of determining the origin and destination of a piece of information(ie, IP/Mac Address)

### Personal Area Network (PAN)

ultra small network used for personal use.

- smartphone to laptop
- smart phone hands free car calling.
- smart watch to smartphone

### Local Area Network (LAN)

a computer network within a small geographical area.

- home networks
- small office networks

### wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)

A LAN that is fully dependent on wireless connectivity.

### Campus Area Network (CAN)

Computer network of multiple interconnected LANs in a geographical area

### Metropolitan Area Network (MAP)

Lareger than a campus area but smaller than a wide area network.

### Wide Area Network (WAN)

A Computer network that expands over a large geoghraphical distance.
Typically accross multiple cities and countries.

## NetWork Achitecture

### Peer to peer

- no dedicated servers.
- no centralised control over shared resources.
- All computers can act as either a server or client.
- easy to set up and common in homes and small business.

### Client-server

- server provide resources.
- client recieve resources.
- Server provide centralised control over network resources.
- CENTRALISED user accounts, security, and access controls to simplify network administration
- difficult to sertup and requires an IT administrator.
