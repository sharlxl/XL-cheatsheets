# Analyzing and Storing Logs

## SystemLogging

- logs are used to audit the system and troubleshoot problems
- many systems record logs of event in text files which are kept in `/var/log` directory.
- systemd-journald and rsyslog services handles the syslog messages in RHEL8

> /var/log/messages
> /var/log/secure
> /var/log/maillog
> /var/log/cron
> /var/log/boot.log

## Logging events to the system

> /etc/rsyslog.conf

Syslog Server operates any log message using the following scheme:

> type(facility).priority(severity) destination(Where to send the log)

### type(facility)

The facility of type data is represented by the internal system processes that generates the messages. In Linux internal processes (facilities) that generate logs are standardized as follows:

- auth = msges generated by authentication processes (login)
- cron = msges generated by scheduled processes (crontab)
- daemon = msges generated by deamons (internal services)
- Kernel = msges generated by the Linux Kernel itself
- mail = msges generated by a mail server
- syslog = msges generated by the syslog daemon itself
- lpr = messages generated by local printers or a print server
- local0 - local7 = custom msges defined by an administrator (local7 is usually assigned for Cisci or windows.)

### priority(severity)

Each priority is assigned with a standard abbreviation and a numbe as described below. the 7th priority is the highest level

- emerg = Emergency(lvl 0)
- alert = Alerts(lvl 1)
- err = Errors(lvl 2)
- warn = Warnings(lvl 3)
- notice = Notifications(lvl 4)
- info = Information(lvl 6)
- debug = Debugging(lvl 7)

Special keywords:

- - = all facilites
- none = The facilities have no given priorities

## Log File rotation

Logs are rotated by the logrotate utility to keep them from filling up the file system containing /var/log  
`logrotate`
