# FailOver Clustering

What is Failover Clustering?

- a group of computers that work together to increase the availability and scalability of the clustered roles.
- the clustered servers (called nodes) are connected by physical cables and by software
- If one or more of the cluster nodes fail, other nodes begin to provide service in a process known as failover
- clustered roles are proactively monitored to verify that they are working properly.
- If they are not working, another node in the cluster runs the workload.
